# Repository Guidelines

<!-- SDKWORK-AGENTS-GENERATED: v2 -->

## SDKWORK Soul

Read `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before executing tasks in this root. Follow specs before memory, dictionary before context, stop on ambiguity, and evidence before completion.

## SDKWORK Standards

Canonical SDKWORK specs path from this root:

- `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`

Do not copy root standard text into this repository. If these relative paths do not resolve, stop and report the broken workspace layout.

## Application Identity

Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` only when the task touches Agents application behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release metadata, app-owned capabilities, packaging, or deployment. Agent runtime SPI and persistence are owned by `../sdkwork-kernel/`.

## Local Dictionary Structure

- `AGENTS.md`: repository agent entrypoint and relative SDKWork spec index.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CODEX.md`: compatibility shims that point to `AGENTS.md`.
- `sdkwork.app.config.json`: Agents application identity and capability metadata.
- `sdkwork.workflow.json`: GitHub packaging/release workflow manifest governed by `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`.
- `.github/workflows/package.yml`: thin reusable workflow call only.
- `etc/`: deployable-root source configuration governed by `SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md`; runtime values must not be moved into the app manifest.
- `.sdkwork/`: repository/application AI workspace metadata.
- `specs/`: local application/component contracts.
- `apis/`, `apps/`, `crates/`, `sdks/`, `database/`, `deployments/`, `scripts/`, `tools/`, `docs/`, `tests/`.
- `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`: language/build manifests.

## Documentation Canon

- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
- [docs/product/prd/PRD.md](docs/product/prd/PRD.md)
- [docs/architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [docs/architecture/tech/TECH-api-specification.md](docs/architecture/tech/TECH-api-specification.md)

## Spec Resolution Order

Use dynamic progressive loading:

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` and any nearer component-level `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` only when app behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release, packaging, or app-owned capabilities are touched.
3. Read local `specs/README.md` and `specs/component.spec.json` only when the task touches that local contract.
4. Read `../sdkwork-kernel/specs/README.md` when agent kernel SPI boundaries are touched.
5. Read `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`, then only the task-specific root specs.
6. Inspect implementation files after the dictionary and relevant specs are clear.

Do not load the whole repository or every root spec before identifying the task surface.

## Required Specs By Task Type

- Agent/workflow changes: `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Package script changes: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/APP_RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/CONFIG_SPEC.md`.
- Any code change: `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`, plus only the touched language/framework spec.
- Rust code: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`; add `../sdkwork-kernel/specs/AGENT_KERNEL_SPEC.md` for agent SPI work.
- API/SDK changes: `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md`.
- Database changes: `../sdkwork-specs/DATABASE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/DATABASE_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`.
- File upload: `../sdkwork-specs/DRIVE_SPEC.md` — must use sdkwork-drive Drive Uploader.
- Runtime/deployment/release: `../sdkwork-specs/DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`.

Language-specific specs are on-demand; do not load Rust, Java, TypeScript, and frontend specs for unrelated tasks.

## Int64 Wire Contract (API_SPEC §13.6)

- OpenAPI `int64` fields and parameters `MUST` be `type: string`, `format: int64`,
  a decimal `pattern` such as `^-?[0-9]+$`, and `x-sdkwork-int64-string: true`.
  `type: integer, format: int64` is a contract violation: generated TypeScript
  SDKs then emit `number`, and browsers silently round ids past
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53), replaying wrong ids into lookups.
- Rust response DTOs `MUST` serialize `i64` wire fields with
  `#[serde(with = "sdkwork_utils_rust::serde_int64")]` (or `::option`); request
  boundaries parse inbound strings with the same helper.
- Generated TypeScript SDKs keep `int64` as `string`; frontend code `MUST NOT`
  convert ids/snowflake ids/sequence ids to `number` for storage, comparison,
  or submission.
- Verification: `node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-operation-patterns.mjs --workspace .`

## Code Style Rules

Read `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` before code changes. Use `sdkwork-utils-rust` for shared helpers. Do not duplicate kernel agent runtime logic in this repository.

Build scripts, dev runners, and `pnpm clean` must follow `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` §7 (Build Source Integrity And Self-Healing). Git-tracked build-critical source files must be verified before builds and self-healed from git when missing; `clean` must not delete them.

## Build, Test, and Verification

Use canonical root package scripts from `PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`:

```powershell
pnpm verify
pnpm check
pnpm topology:validate
pnpm db:validate
```

## Agent Execution Rules

Do not rely on memory when a relevant SDKWork spec exists. Do not replace generated SDK calls with raw HTTP. Stop when kernel ownership, API authority, or SDK family boundaries are ambiguous.

## Task-Specific Standards

SDK consumer work loads `../sdkwork-specs/APP_SDK_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md` and runs `check-app-sdk-consumer-imports.mjs`. API work loads `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md` and its operation/envelope validators. List/search work loads `../sdkwork-specs/PAGINATION_SPEC.md` and runs `check-pagination.mjs`. Source configuration work loads `../sdkwork-specs/SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md` and runs `check-source-config-standard.mjs`. Link these authorities instead of copying their normative bodies into `AGENTS.md`.

## Human Review Rules

Human review is required for breaking public API changes, schema migrations, security exceptions, kernel dependency boundary changes, and generated SDK ownership changes.


## Deployment Standard (bin/)

Per `../sdkwork-specs/MODULE_BIN_SPEC.md`, this module ships the standardized
nine-entrypoint `bin/` family; all build/package/deploy/installer work `MUST`
go through them. See `bin/README.md` for the usage card and
`bin/lib/module.sh` for the delegation wiring (hooks not yet wired to a
canonical repository command fail fast with guidance).

- App types declared: see `SDKWORK_APP_TYPES` in `bin/lib/module.sh`;
  environments: `development`, `test`, `staging`, `demo`, `production`.
- Image reference: `registry.sdkwork.com/apps/<docker-name>:<version>`
  (`DOCKER_SPEC.md` §2.1; no `latest`, no env-suffixed tags).
- Authoritative specs: `MODULE_BIN_SPEC.md`, `DOCKER_SPEC.md`,
  `DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md`, `OPERATIONS_SPEC.md`.

## Destructive Operation Safety

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATION_SPEC.md`.

Deletion must be explicit, enumerated, and reviewable. Deleting by pattern instead of by named
path is forbidden. Wildcards are for read-only commands only.

- `git rm -r`, `git rm` over a directory or pattern, and `git clean -f`/`-fd`/`-fdx` are
  FORBIDDEN. A recursive `git rm` stages many deletions in one index transaction; if the process
  is interrupted (SIGTERM, timeout, sandbox kill, crash) entries are already gone from disk while
  the index is only half-written, which is silent non-atomic mass data loss.
- Delete tracked files with `rm <exact/path>` on each named path, let `git status --short`
  record the `D` entries, then stage only the enumerated paths. Commit the deletion separately
  from functional changes.
- Shell and script deletion by wildcard is FORBIDDEN: `rm -rf`/`rm -r`/`rm -f` with
  `*`/`**`/`?`/`[...]`/brace expansion, `find ... -delete`, `find ... -exec rm`,
  `find ... | xargs rm`, `for f in *; do rm ...`, `del /S /Q`, `rd /S /Q`,
  `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` on a glob, `shutil.rmtree`, `fs.rm(dir, { recursive: true })`,
  and `rimraf` over a glob.
- A deletion MUST NOT be combined in one shell invocation with a build, install, network, or
  publish step, and MUST NOT derive its targets from an unvalidated argument, environment
  variable, or configuration value.
- Permitted narrow deletion: `rm <exact/path>`; a short literal path list owned by the tool that
  declares it; the module's own generated artifacts through its owning tool
  (`pnpm clean`, `cargo clean`) per `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` §7; and
  `git restore --worktree --source=HEAD -- <exact paths>`.
- Required sequence before any deletion: enumerate exact paths; confirm every path resolves inside
  the active repository or module root; classify tracked/generated/cached/unknown; prefer `rm`
  plus tracked `git status`; delete in batches of 20 or fewer with a status check between
  batches; report the removed paths and the authorizing decision.
- Request explicit human confirmation before deleting any git-tracked path, any directory tree,
  any path resolving outside the active repository root, or more than 20 paths.
- Recovery after an accidental mass deletion: clear a stale `.git/index.lock`, write the path
  list to a file INSIDE the repository (never `/tmp` on Windows, where the Git Bash path space
  and the native tool path space disagree), and run a single
  `git restore --worktree --pathspec-from-file=<repo-relative-list>`. Never loop one
  version-control call per path; the same termination cause interrupts the loop part-way.

Verification (from the repository root):

```bash
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/sync-agent-destructive-operation-standard.mjs --root . --check
```
